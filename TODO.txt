1. Backup System Enhancement
Feature: Allow users to create backups of all important system files (not just the registry). This could include system settings, drivers, or even custom user configuration files.
Benefit: Provides a complete backup before running any system changes, ensuring users can fully restore their systems if anything goes wrong.

2. User-Selectable Software Installations
Feature: Allow users to choose software to install from a list (rather than automatically installing everything from softwarelist.txt).
Benefit: Provides more flexibility and control for users, allowing them to select only the software they want to install.

3. Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Version
Feature: Convert the script into a GUI tool using PowerShell forms or another framework like WinForms or WPF.
Benefit: Provides a more user-friendly interface for those who prefer graphical interfaces over command-line.

4. Automatic System Restore Points
Feature: Add functionality to automatically create a system restore point before making any major system changes (like registry edits or software installations).
Benefit: Enhances the safety of operations by providing an easy rollback option in case of errors or issues.
